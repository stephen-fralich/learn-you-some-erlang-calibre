Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good! on Kindle
===============================================
These are the sources that I used to generate [Fred Hebert's book][1] in the
Kindle-supported .mobi format.


How to Generate the Book
------------------------
1. Make sure you're connected to the Internet. The ebook will be generated using
the latest content on the website.
2. Make sure you have PHP >= 5.3 installed and the executable is on PATH.
3. Download [Calibre][2] and make sure the executable is on PATH.
4. Run: `$ make`
5. Load build/learn-you-some-erlang.mobi on your Kindle device or test it with
the [Calibre][2].
6. Run `$ make pdf` to build a PDF file.
